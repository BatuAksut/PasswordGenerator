# Password Manager Features

## Overview
Usage details of the Password Manager app:

### Menu Options
1. **Generate default password**  
   Generates a password with a balanced mix of lowercase, uppercase, digits, and symbols.

2. **Generate password of specific length**  
   Lets the user specify the desired length for the generated password.

3. **Generate password from specific character sets**  
   Allows fine-tuning which character categories (lowercase, uppercase, digits, symbols) are included.  
   Also provides an option to use a **custom character set**, such as only "abc123!@".
